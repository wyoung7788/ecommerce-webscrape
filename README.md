Purpose of project:
To allow for users to add items to their cart from Target (not decided whether that will be stored in a separate database or on Target itself) 
or to track a general product search (e.g.: "paper towels") and the application will notify them once the price drops (or the user can set a certain threshold
to be notified (25% drop, etc.).
